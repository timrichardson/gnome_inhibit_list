# Install Tips
The pip install adds an executable to your path (see usage).

This script assumes you are using Gnome.

## Prerequisite packages
The python package PyGObject is a prerequisite.
Installation is automatic, but certain system packages must be installed, according to the requirements of PyGObject

For Ubuntu 20.10 and 21.04 (perhaps others):

``sudo apt install python3-pip libgirepository1.0-dev gcc libcairo2-dev pkg-config python3-dev gir1.2-gtk-3.0``

for other distributions, see https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html

You may get a warning that ~/.local/bin is not on your path. 

When you next login, this will be fixed.


# Usage

To see what is inhibiting you on the command line, run:

``inhibitors list``

To start up the tray widget, run:

``inhibitors widget``
Clicking on the widget will reveal which apps are inhibiting power management, if any.

If you'd like it to start up on login, add the following to your startup scripts:

``gtk-launch inhibitor-widget``

## Example
With the Gnome Shell plugin Caffeine activate, and a Google Meet running in Firefox:

    $ inhibitors list
    Listing inhibitors reported by dbus:
    Inhibitor: firefox audio-playing
    Inhibitor: user Inhibit by Caffeine


# Comparison with systemd

we can do
``$ systemd-inhibit --list``

which on my desktop gives:

  The Caffeine plugin inhibit is the third line from the bottom. However, it is not obvious. I am sure in this case, because when I deactivate caffeine, the third line disappears.
  
The Google Meet inhibitor is not even listed at all. However, it is definitely an inhibitor.
